Welcome to my first website.

I'm as surprised I actualy coded this as you are lol.

If there is anything you can learn from this site it is that if i can do it so can you!

In order to get the best value from our doc, each recipe should be followed EXACTLY as written or they will not come out as planned.

Make sure you remember to have and keep it light!

Cooking can be a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes. (kind of like writing code haha)

Take it slow, enjoy the experience, turn on some music, invited friends over, or whatever else helps you craft a culinary experience beyond the food.
