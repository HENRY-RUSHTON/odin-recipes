This document outlines some various recipes for churros and brownies.

In order to get the best value from our doc, each recipe shoudl be followed EXACTLY as written or they will not come out as planned.

Make sure you remember to have and keep it light!

Cooking can be a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes. (kind of like writing code haha)

Take it slow, enjoy the experience, turn on some music, invited friends over, or whatever else helps you craft a culinary experience beyond the food.
